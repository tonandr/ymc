# Yaw misalignment calibrator of wind turbine

I developed yaw misalignment calibrator of wind turbine while participating in 
the contest as the link.

I developed this model using RNN and Kalman filter.
In this contest, I couldn't get an effective score for last submission due to error.
But I got 920986.23 as the maximum score. So I can assure that my model is valid
although there is a bug.

I plan to correct a bug and document this tutorial.
